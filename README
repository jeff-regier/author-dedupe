Slight variations in the spellings of people's names make it difficult to tell
which names refer to the same person. This problem is particularly striking 
when processing large sets of author names.

Author-Dedupe is Python software for merging author names which refer to the
same person. Simple string matching via regular expressions is used, but that's
just the start. Author-Dedupe iteratively partitions the authors' names, with
each successive iteration further refining the partition of author names. The
algorithm is detailed on the project web site.

Input is read from a file containing one author name per line. For each line of
input, one line containing the corrected name is written to the output file.
Sample input and output files may be found in the 'sample' subdirectory. The
main executable is found at 'src/author-dedupe.py'. It takes two arguments:
an input file and an output file.
